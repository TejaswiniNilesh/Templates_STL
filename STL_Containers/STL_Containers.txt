STL : Standard Template Library
- STL is a part of C++ Standard libary
- OOPs concentrates on the data aspect
- Generic programming concentrates on algorithms
 - STL is an example of generic programming.
- STL has three basic components : 
1.Containers : Collection of elements
2. Iterators : Navigates through containers
3. Algorithms : 

- Containers types :
1. Sequenctial : Element has position based on insertion time and place of insertion.
	Ex. Vector, deque, list.
2. Associative : Element has position based on sorting criteria.
	Ex. : set, multiset, map, multimap

- Iterators types :
1. Input : Read only. istream_iterators
2. Output  : Write-only. ostream_iterators
3. Forward : input and output. Does not support operator--. Move only in forward direction.
4. Bidirectional : forward and backward.
5. Random access : bidirectional with arithmetic support. Vector, string and deque each provide random access iterators.

Vector : Dynamic array, random access, 
	insert and delete at the end is fast.
	insert or delete at other positions takes time.
Deque : dynamic array grow in both the directions.
	insert at end and at begin is fast.
	insert at middle takes time.
List :
