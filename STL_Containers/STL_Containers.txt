STL : Standard Template Library
- STL is a part of C++ Standard libary
- OOPs concentrates on the data aspect
- Generic programming concentrates on algorithms
 - STL is an example of generic programming.
- STL has three basic components : 
1.Containers : Collection of elements
2. Iterators : Navigates through containers
3. Algorithms : 

- Containers types :
1. Sequenctial : Element has position based on insertion time and place of insertion.
	Ex. Vector, deque, list.
2. Associative : Element has position based on sorting criteria.
	Ex. : set, multiset, map, multimap

- Iterators types :
1. Input : Read only
2. Output  :
3. Forward : 
4. Bidirectional : 
5. Random access :
