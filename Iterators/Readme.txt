- Iterators offer common interfaces for any container type.
- Templates make algorithm indpendent of data type
- Iterators make algorithms independent of type of container.
- Iterartor is used to navigate through container
- Operators are like pointers.
- Iterators are smart pointers which can iterate thrugh complex data structure of containers
- Types of iterators : 
1.Input : Reads values from a container to program. They dont modify elements of container.
2.Output : Writes values from a program. Single pass write only
3.Forward : Go only forward one element at a time.
4.Bi-directional : supports increment and decremnt also.
Ex. Palindrome check. Starts from both the ends for checking
5. Random access iterator : sort() and search() requires jump to any element in a container.
